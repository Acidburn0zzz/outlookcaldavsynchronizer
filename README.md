## User Documentation ##

After installing the plugin, a new ribbon called 'Caldav Synchronizer' is added in Outlook with 6 menu items. 
- Synchronize now
- Synchronization Profiles
- General Options
- About
- Reports
- Status

Use the Synchronization Profiles dialog to configure different synchronization profiles. Each profile is responsible for synchronizing one Outlook calendar/task or contact folder with a remote folder of a CalDAV/CardDAV server.

- **Add** adds a new empty profile
- **Delete** deletes the current profile
- **Copy** copies the current profile to a new one
- **Clear cache** delete the sync cache and start a new initial sync with the next sync run.
- **Is active ** If deactivated, current profile is not synced anymore without the need to delete the profile.

When adding a new profile you can choose between a generic CalDAV/CardDAV, a google profile to simplify the google profile creation and predefined CalDAV/CardDAV profiles for Fruux, Posteo, Yandex and GMX where the DAV Url for autodiscovery is already entered. 

The following properties need to be set for a new generic profile:

- *Profile name*: An arbitrary name for the profile, which will be displayed in the tree view.
- - *Outlook settings*:
	- **Outlook Folder:** Outlook folder that should be used for synchronization. You can choose a calendar, contact or task folder. Depending on the folder type, the matching server resource type in the server settings must be used.
	- **Synchronize items immediately after change** Trigger a partial synchronization run immediately after an item is created, changed or deleted in Outlook (with a 10 seconds delay).
- *Server settings*:
	- **DAV Url:** URL of the remote CalDAV or CardDAV server. You should use a HTTPS connection here for security reason! The Url must end with a **/** e.g. **https://myserver.com/** 
	- If you only have a self signed certificate, add the self signed cert to the Local Computer Trusted Root Certification Authorities. You can import the cert by running the MMC as Administrator. If that fails, see section *'Advanced options'*
	- **Username:** Username to connect to the CalDAV server
	- **Password:** Password used for the connection. The password will be saved encrypted in the option config file.
	- ** Use IMAP/POP3 Account Password** Instead of entering the password you can use the IMAP/Pop3 Password from the Outlook Account associated with the folder, the password is fetched from the Windows registry entry of the Outlook profile. 
	- **Email address:** email address used as remote identity for the CalDAV server, necessary to synchronize the organizer.
- *Sync settings*:
	- Synchronization settings
		- **Outlook -> Server (Replicate):** syncronizes everything from Outlook to the server (one way)
		- **Outlook <- Server (Replicate):** synchronizes everything from the server to Outlook (one way)
		- **Outlook -> Server (Merge):** synchronizes everything from Outlook to the server but don't change events created in on the server
		- **Outlook <- Server (Merge):** synchronizes everything from the server to Outlook but don't change events created in Outlook
		- **Outlook <-> Server (Two-Way):** Two-Way synchronization between Outlook and the server with one of the following conflict resolution
	- Conflict resolution (only used in Two-Way synchronization mode)
		- **Outlook Wins:** If an event is modified in Outlook and in the server since last snyc, use the Outlook version. If an event is modified in Outlook and deleted in the server since last snyc, also use the Outlook version. If an event is deleted in Outlook and modified in the server, also delete it in the server.
		- **Server Wins:** If an event is modified in Outlook and in the server since last snyc, use the server version. If an event is modified in Outlook and deleted in the server since last snyc, also delete it in Outlook. If an event is deleted in Outlook and modified in the server, recreate it in Outlook.
		- **Automatic:** If event is modified in Outlook and in the server since last snyc, use the last recent modified version. If an event is modified in Outlook and deleted in the server since last snyc, delete it also in Outlook. If an event is deleted in Outlook and modified in the server, also delete it in the server
	- **Synchronization interval (minutes):** Choose the interval for synchronization in minutes, if 'Manual only' is choosen, there is no automatic sync but you can use the 'Synchronize now' menu item.
	- **Synchronization timespan past (days)** and
	- **Synchronization timespan future (days)** For performance reasons it is useful to sync only a given timespan of a big calendar, especially past events are normally not necessary to sync after a given timespan.

If you expand the tree view of the profile you can configure network and proxy options and mapping configuration options.

- **Network and proxy options**: Here you can configure advanced network options and proxy settings. 
	- **Close connection after each request** Don't use KeepAlive for servers which don't support it. 
	- **Use Preemptive Authentication** Send Authentication header with each request to avoid 401 responses and resending the request, disable only if the server has problems with preemptive authentication.
	- **Force basic authentication** Set basic authentication headers to avoid problems with negotiation or digest authentication with servers like OS X. This is only recommended if you use a secure HTTPS connection, otherwise passwords are sent in cleartext.
	- **Use System Default Proxy** Use proxy settings from Internet Explorer or config file, uses default credentials if available for NTLM authentication.
	- **Use manual proxy configuration** Specify proxy URL as `http://<your-proxy-domain>:<your-proxy-port>` and optional Username and Password for Basic Authentication.
	
- **Mapping Configuration**: Here you can configure what properties should be synced.
	- For appointments you can choose if you want to map reminders (just upcoming, all or none) and the description body.
	- *Create events on server in UTC:* Use UTC instead of Outlook Appointment Timezone for creating events on CalDAV server. Needed for GMX for example. Not recommended for general use, because recurrence exceptions over DST changes can't be mapped and Appointments with different start and end timezones can't be represented.
	- In *Privacy settings* you can configure if you want to map Outlook private appointments to CLASS:CONFIDENTIAL and vice versa. This could be useful for Owncloud for example, if you share your calendar with others and they should see start/end dates of your private appointments.
	- In *Scheduling settings* you can configure if you want to map attendees and organizer and if notifications should be sent by the server. 
	- Use *Don't send appointment notifications for SOGo servers and SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT for other servers if you want to send invitations from Outlook and avoid that the server sends invitations too, but be aware that not all servers (e.g. Google) support the SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT setting. 
	- You can also define a filter category so that multiple CalDAV-Calendars can be synchronized into one Outlook calendar via the defined category (see Category Filter and Color below). 
	- For contacts you can configure if birthdays should be mapped or not. If birthdays are mapped, Outlook also creates an recurring appointment for every contact with a defined birthday.
	- You can also configure if contact photos should be mapped or not. Contact photo mapping from Outlook to the server doesn't work in Outlook 2007.
	- Fix imported phone number format adds round brackets to the area code of phone numbers, so that Outlook can show correct phone number details with country and area code, e.g. +1 23 45678 is mapped to +1 (23) 45678.
	- For tasks (not for Google task profiles) you can configure if you want to map reminders (just upcoming, all or none), the priority of the task, the description body and if recurring tasks should be synchronized.	

### Scheduling settings and resources ###

If your server supports resources (for SOGo see [http://wiki.sogo.nu/ResourceConfiguration](http://wiki.sogo.nu/ResourceConfiguration))
disable "set SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT" in Mapping Configuration, so that the server can handle the resource invitation mails, add the resource email adress as attendee in the Outlook appointment and choose type ressource (house icon) for it.
 
### Category Filter and Color ###

If you want to sync multiple CalDAV calendars into one Outlook folder you can configure an Outlook category for filtering in the *Mapping Configuration*. You can choose a category from the dropdown list of all available Outlook categories or enter a new category name.
For all events from the server the defined category is added in Outlook, when syncing back from Outlook to the server only appointments with that category are considered but the filter category is removed. The category name must not contain any commas or semicolons!
With the checkbox below you can also negate the filter and sync all appointments except this category.
It is possible to choose the color of the category or to fetch the calendar color from the server and map it to the nearest supported Outlook category color with the button *Fetch Color*. With *Set DAV Color* it is also possible to sync the choosen category color back to set the server calendar color accordingly. With *Category Shortcut Key* you can define the shortcut key of the selected category for easier access when creating appointments.

### Google Calender / Addressbooks / Tasks settings ###

For Google you can use the new Google type profile which simplifies the setup. You just need to enter the email address of your google account. When testing the settings, you will be redirected to your browser to enter your Google Account password and grant access rights to your Google Calender, Contacts and Tasks for OutlookCalDavSynchronizer via the safe OAuth protocol. After that Autodiscovery will try to find available calendar, addressbook and task resources. For tasks you can choose the tasklist you want to sync with an Outlook task folder and the id of the task list is shown in the Discovered Url. With the button 'Edit Url' you still can manually change the Url e.g. when you want to sync a shared google calendar from another account.

If you get an error with insufficient access you need to refresh the token by deleting the previous token in 
`C:\Users\<your Username>\AppData\Roaming\Google.Apis.Auth`

### GMX calendar settings ###

For GMX calendar use the GMX Calendar account type, which sets the autodiscovery DAV Url `https://caldav.gmx.net`
Since GMX doesn't allow to create events with the Windows Timezone IDs, for the GMX account type the `Create events on server in UTC` checkbox in Mapping Configuration is checked by default to avoid errors when creating events and syncing from Outlook to GMX.

For GMX addressbook use the DAV Url `https://carddav.gmx.net`

### Synology NAS settings ###

When test settings for your synology NAS profile, you can ignore the warning "The specified Url does not support calendar queries. Some features like time range filter may not work!".
But a user reported, that "Disable directory browsing" setting **must not** be enabled for the calendar folder for proper syncing.

For Synology NAS with SSL support use port 5006 and the following settings in your NAS:
In Synology DSM Navigate to control panel > Terminal & SNMP
Select Enable SSH 
Then enter Advanced Settings and set it to High
Now it will work on port 5006 with https.

### iCloud settings ###

To find the correct DAV url for iCloud you need some Informations from the MacOS, where you are connected with your calendar.

Open with Textedit: `~/Library/Calendars/*.caldav/Info.plist` 
(Its in the hidden User-Library)

Check iCloud Path: PrincipalURL 
    `<string>https://p**-caldav.icloud.com/*********/principal/</string>`

Check: DefaultCalendarPath 
    `<string>/*********/calendars/********-****-****-****-************</string>`

Then you get the DAV url of the calendar:
    `https://p**-caldav.icloud.com/*********/calendars/********-****-****-****-************/`

### Autodiscovery ###

You can use the exact calendar/addressbook URL or the principal url and use the 'Test settings' button in the option dialog to try to autodiscover available calendars and addressbooks on the server. You can  then choose one of the found calendars or addressbooks in the new window.
If your server has redirections for well-known Urls (./well-known/caldav/ and ./well-known/carddav/ ) you need to enter the server name only (without path).

### Proxy Settings ###
You can now set manual proxy settings in the *Network and proxy options* dialog in each profile. To override the default proxy settings from Windows Internet Explorer you can also specify settings in the app config file, see config options below.
More information can be found at
[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sa91de1e%28v=vs.110%29.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sa91de1e%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)

### General Options and SSL settings ###
In the General Options Dialog you can change settings which are used for all synchronization profiles.

- **Automatically check for newer versions** set to false to disable checking for updates.
- **Check Internet connection before sync run** checks if an interface is up and try DNS query to dns.msftncsi.com first and if that fails try to download http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt with the configured proxy before each sync run to avoid error reports if network is unavailable after hibernate for example. Disable this option if you are in a local network where DNS and that URL is blocked.
- **Store data in roaming folder** set to true if you need to store state and profile data in the AppData\Roaming\ directory for roaming profiles in a AD domain for example. When changing this option, a restart of Outlook is required.
- **Fix invalid settings** Fixes invalid settings automatically, when synchronization profiles are edited.
- **Include custom message classes in Outlook filter** Disabled by default, enable only if you have custom forms with message_classes other than the default IPM.Appointment/Contact/Task. For better performance, Windows Search Service shouldn't be deactivated if this option is enabled.
- **Enable Tray Icon** Enabled by default, you can disable the tray icon in the Windows Taskbar if you don't need it.
- **Use modern UI for sync profiles** Enabled by default, complete redesign of the synchronization profiles dialog using WPF, switches to the old WinForms UI if disabled. 

If you have problems with SSL/TLS and self-signed certificates, you can change the following settings at your own risk.
The recommended way would be to add the self signed cert to the Local Computer Trusted Root Certification Authorities
You can import the cert by running the MMC as Administrator.

- **Disable Certificate Validation** set to true to disable SSL/TLS certificate validation, major security risk, use with caution!
- **Enable Tls12** set to false to disable TLS12, not recommended 
- **Enable Ssl3** set to true to enable deprecated SSLv3, major security risk, use with caution! 

In the **General Logging** section you can show or clear the log file and define the log level. Possible log levels are `INFO` and  `DEBUG`.

### Reports of sync runs ###

You can also configure Synchronization reports for all profiles, this can be configured via general Options:

- **Log** You can choose if you want to generate reports for *"Only sync runs with errors"* or *"Sync runs with errors or warnings"* or *"All sync runs"*.
- **Show immediately** configures if the Sync reports should be shown immediately after a sync run with errors, with warnings or errors, or not at all.
- **Delete reports older than (days)** Automatically delete reports which are older than the days configured.

You can show reports manually with the **Reports** button in the CalDav Synchronizer Ribbon. There you can choose from available reports (shown as profile name with timestamp of the sync run) and see informations about items synced and if there were any warnings or errors. You can also delete reports or add them to a zip file via the context menu. If the last sync run lead to any errors, a warning symbol is shown in the Ribbon or the Report window opens if configured in the general options.

### Synchronization Status and System TrayIcon with Notifications ###

With the **Status** button in the CalDav Synchronizer Ribbon or via doubleclick from the TrayIcon you can access the status of the active sync profiles with their last sync run shown in minutes ago and the status OK, error, or warning. When clicking on the profile name you get to the according sync profile settings, when clicking the status icon, you can open the according sync report. When a sync run has any errors or warnings you will get a notification from the CalDav Synchronizer TrayIcon.

## Trouble Shooting ##

Options and state information is normally stored in the following folder:

    C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\CalDavSychronizer
If you activated Store data in roaming folder the location is changed to the following folder:

    C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Roaming\CalDavSychronizer

There is one `options_<your outlook profile>.xml` file which stores the options for each outlook profile.
For each sync profile there is a subfolder with state information stored in a relations.xml file after the inital sync. If you delete that folder, a fresh inital sync is performed. In the Synchronization profiles dialog a context menu is available in each profile (right click), which allows to open the cache directory and read the relations.xml file.

Each synchronization attempt is logged in the `log.txt` file. There you can find information about sync duration and the amount of added, deleted or modified events. Errors and Exceptions are logged aswell. You can view and clear the log file in **General Options**. There you can also change the log level from `INFO` to `DEBUG`. 

 
### Debugging and more config options ###

In the install dir (The default is `'C:\Program Files (x86)\Gerhard Zehetbauer\CalDavSynchronizer'`) you will find the app config file

    CalDavSynchronizer.dll.config

In that xml file you can config timeout parameters and config options in the section `appSettings`
After changing parameters you have to restart Outlook.

- **loadOperationThresholdForProgressDisplay**: amount of sync operations to show the progress bar (default 50)
- **calDavConnectTimeout**: timeout for caldav connects (default 90 sec)
- **enableTaskSynchronization** Support for task sync true or false

In the section `system.net` you can define proxy settings, e.g. use of NTLM credentials

    <defaultProxy useDefaultCredentials="true">
    </defaultProxy>

In this section you can also allow UnsafeHeaderParsing if the server sends invalid http headers.

    <system.net>
    	<settings>
    		<servicePointManager expect100Continue="false" />
    		<httpWebRequest useUnsafeHeaderParsing="true" />
    	</settings>
    </system.net>

In the section `log4net` you can define the log level for the main log (also possible in general options now) and for the caldav data access, 
    level value can be DEBUG or INFO, e.g. :

	<root>
      <level value="DEBUG" />
      <appender-ref ref="MainLogAppender" />
    </root>
    
### Common network errors ###

- System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Response status code does not indicate success: '401' ('Unauthorized').
	- Wrong Username and/or Password provided.
- System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: A connection that was expected to be kept alive was closed by the server.
	- The server has KeepAlive disabled. Use *"Close connection after each request"* in **Network and proxy options**.
- System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The server committed a protocol violation. Section=ResponseStatusLine
	- The server sends invalid headers. Enable the commented out option **useUnsafeHeaderparsing** in the app config file, see **Debugging and more config options** above.
